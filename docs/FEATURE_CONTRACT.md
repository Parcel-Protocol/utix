# The RevyHubX feature contract

Every tool in RevyHubX is a **vertical slice**: one directory under `features/`
that owns its logic, validation, state, UI, tests, fixtures, request mocks and
documentation. Nothing about a tool lives outside its own directory.

This document is the specification each tool issue is written against.
`npm run verify:features` enforces it, and CI runs that check on every pull
request.

## Why slices instead of layers

The usual layout — `components/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`, `tests/` — forces every
contributor to edit the same shared files. With dozens of open pull requests
that produces constant conflicts in `constants.ts`, barrel files and route
tables, and none of the work is really independent.

Here, adding a tool means **creating one new directory and editing nothing
else**:

- Routing is a single dynamic route, `app/tools/[slug]/page.tsx`. You do not
  create a route file.
- The registry is **generated** from the directories under `features/` by
  `scripts/generate-registry.mjs`, and the generated files are gitignored. You
  do not edit a registry, a navigation list, or a constants file.
- Navigation, the dashboard and search all read that generated registry, so a
  new tool appears in all three the moment its directory exists.

Two contributors working on two different tools cannot conflict, because they
never touch the same file.

**Minimum 20 files.** A complete slice lands at 23-25 without padding.

Scaffold the whole structure with:

```bash
npm run new:feature -- <slug> "<Title>" <category>

## The rules behind the layout

### 1. Logic never throws for expected failures

Anything the user can cause is a value, not an exception. Use
`Result<T, Code>` from `@/core/result/result`:

```ts
if (!StrKey.isValidEd25519PublicKey(accountId)) return err("invalid_address");
return ok({ accountId });
```

Error **codes** are the interface — never English strings. The UI maps codes to
copy. That is what makes messages translatable, testable and refactorable.

### 2. Error codes are specific enough to act on

`request_failed` is a last resort. A user who typed one wrong character and a
user whose account does not exist on the selected network need different
advice, so they get different codes. Every code must map to copy that says what
to do next.

### 3. All strings live in `copy.ts`

No user-facing text inside components. Tests import `copy` and assert against
it, so wording changes never break the test suite.

### 4. Amounts and dates go through `@/core/format`

Stellar amounts have 7 decimal places and can exceed `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`,
so they are never parsed as floats. Every slice that accepts or displays an
amount uses `@/core/format/amount`:

- **Input** — `parseAmount` accepts one fixed, locale-independent grammar:
  ASCII digits, an optional leading `-`, and `.` as the only decimal
  separator, with at most seven decimals. A comma, space, apostrophe or
  underscore is rejected with `grouping_separator` instead of being guessed at:
  `1,234` is 1234 in en-US and 1.234 in de-DE. Map that code to copy telling
  the user to write `1234.5`.
- **Display** — `formatAmount` shows the value in the user's locale (grouping,
  decimal separator, digit shapes) through `Intl.NumberFormat`, but only the
  whole part goes through `Intl`, as a `BigInt`; the fraction digits are
  appended unchanged, so no locale ever rounds a stroop away.

Dates use `formatDateTime` / `formatUnixSeconds` from `@/core/format/date`:
the user's locale decides the shape, and the time zone is always UTC and
printed, so ledger times can be compared against explorers.

### 5. Four UI states, always

Idle (empty state), loading, success, error. The panel composes them; no state
is skipped because it "rarely happens".

### 6. Network results are tagged and derived

If a tool reads the chain, its result belongs to the network it came from.
Store the network beside the state and derive staleness during render — do not
reset in an effect. `useBalanceViewer` is the reference.

### 7. Accessibility is a test, not an intention

`a11y.test.tsx` runs axe over the real rendered markup and must report zero
WCAG 2.1 A/AA violations, in **at least two states** — usually initial and
"result shown". Use `Field` from `@/core/ui` so labels, hints, `aria-invalid`
and `aria-describedby` are wired correctly for free.

Announce errors once. A field-level error already carries `role="alert"`, so do
not also render a banner for it — see `TrustlineCheckerPanel`.

### 8. Fixtures are derived, never hand-typed

Hand-written Stellar addresses have wrong checksums. Derive them:

```ts
const seed = (byte: number) => Keypair.fromRawEd25519Seed(Buffer.alloc(32, byte));
export const accountId = seed(1).publicKey();
```

### 9. Requests are mocked with MSW, never with `vi.mock`

Mock at the network boundary so the test exercises the real client. Call
`resetHorizonClients()` before a request when a test changes handlers — the
Horizon client is memoised per network.

### 10. Never accept, display, store or transmit a secret key

Reject anything starting with `S` on the prefix alone, before any checksum
check, and never render it back. `features/address-validator` has two tests
asserting the seed appears in neither component output nor hook state. Every
slice that takes an address needs the equivalent.

### 11. Tests exercise the runtime contract, not just the file layout

Having a `__tests__/` directory proves nothing about behaviour. Every slice's
tests must drive it through its **loading**, **error** and **empty** states
using the shared harness in `@/core/testing/contract`:

```tsx
import { renderFeatureSlice } from "@/core/testing/contract";

const slice = renderFeatureSlice("balance-viewer", <BalanceViewerPanel />);

slice.expectEmptyState();                          // idle, before any input
await user.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: copy.submit }));
await slice.waitForState("loading");               // request in flight
await slice.waitForState("error");                 // request failed
```

The harness asserts against the `data-contract-state` attribute that the shared
state primitives render — `EmptyState` (`"empty"`), `StatusMessage` (`"error"`,
`"success"`, …) and `Skeleton`/`SkeletonRows` (`"loading"`) — instead of against
copy. That is what lets the same three helpers work for a lookup form, a QR
generator and a wallet-connect flow. A slice with a bespoke indicator (a
spinner, a skeleton it renders itself) can carry
`data-contract-state="loading"` on it and get the same treatment.

`npm run verify:features` reads each slice's `__tests__/` sources: if they never
call `expectLoadingState()`, `expectErrorState()` and `expectEmptyState()` (or
the generic `expectState("…")` / `waitForState("…")` forms), the slice fails
with a message naming the state it skips. Slices that predate this rule are
listed in `scripts/feature-contract-migration.json` and are reported as a
warning instead of a failure. **That list is a migration ledger: it must only
shrink, and new slices are never added to it.**

The checker itself is covered by `core/__tests__/verifyFeaturesContract.test.ts`
against the deliberately minimal `good` and `bad` fixture slices under
`scripts/__tests__/fixtures/`, so a regression that makes the rule always pass
(or always fail) fails the normal test run.

## What "done" means

```bash
npm run check     # registry + lint + test + verify:features + build
```

All four must pass, plus:

- [ ] `npm run verify:features -- <slug>` reports OK
- [ ] Tests drive loading/error/empty through `@/core/testing/contract`
- [ ] Every error code has copy that says what to do next
- [ ] `a11y.test.tsx` covers at least two states
- [ ] `README.md` explains the non-obvious decision in the slice, not just what
      the tool does
- [ ] No secret key is ever accepted or echoed
- [ ] Nothing outside `features/<slug>/` was modified

That last line is the important one. If your pull request touches a shared
file, something is wrong with the approach — say so in the issue rather than
working around it.

## Changing this contract

The reasons behind these rules are recorded as architecture decision records
in [adr/](./adr/README.md) — in particular
[0001](./adr/0001-vertical-feature-slices.md) (slices),
[0002](./adr/0002-generated-gitignored-registry.md) (generated registry),
[0003](./adr/0003-result-values-and-error-codes.md) (error codes),
[0004](./adr/0004-slice-local-fixtures-and-network-boundary-mocks.md)
(fixtures and MSW), [0005](./adr/0005-runtime-contract-migration-ledger.md)
(runtime states) and [0006](./adr/0006-shared-amount-and-date-formatting.md)
(amounts and dates).

A pull request that changes this document — a rule, the layout, or what
`verify:features` enforces — must add a new ADR or supersede an existing one in
the same pull request. See [adr/README.md](./adr/README.md) for the format.
