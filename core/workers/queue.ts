/**
 * Background worker framework for delayed and retryable work.
 *
 * Jobs run outside request handlers with a defined payload format, a retry
 * budget and a dead-letter store, so a task that keeps failing preserves enough
 * context to debug instead of being silently dropped.
 *
 * The queue is deliberately in-memory and dependency-free. Work in this app is
 * initiated client-side, so `drainDueJobs()` is called when a path wants its
 * due work executed; a job is never run twice for the same payload, and
 * reprocessing a job by id is idempotent (a finished job is left untouched).
 *
 * A job's status is not a free-form string: every move goes through the
 * `worker_job` lifecycle table in `core/lifecycle/records.ts`. The framework
 * therefore cannot re-queue a settled job, and a job view rendered anywhere in
 * the UI reads its state from the same table the worker uses.
