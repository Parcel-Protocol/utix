/**
 * Read-only reconciliation between stored records, derived balances and
 * external settlement references.
 *
 * Utix stores a lot of small records — jobs, notifications, export envelopes,
 * idempotency claims — and it also *shows* numbers it read from a Stellar
 * ledger. Reconciliation is the process of checking that the stored world
 * still agrees with itself and with the ledger references it was derived from.
 * Nothing here mutates anything:
 *
 * - every check is a pure function of the supplied snapshot;
 * - the snapshot is treated as immutable, so a dry run in CI cannot alter the
 *   state it is inspecting;
 * - drift is reported with **repair guidance**, never applied. A repair that
 *   changes production data is a separate, reviewed operation.
 *
 * Findings fall into four kinds, because they need four different responses:
 *
 * | Kind          | Means                                            |
 * |---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
 * | `missing`     | a record exists on one side and not the other    |
 * | `duplicate`   | two records claim the same identity              |
 * | `stale`       | a record is still open long past its deadline    |
 * | `inconsistent`| two fields of the same record disagree           |
