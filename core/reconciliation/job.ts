/**
 * The reconciliation job itself: a registered, delayed, read-only worker

 * Two things are deliberate. The handler takes its snapshot from a *provider*

 * fixture and prove the job never writes. And the report is kept in memory and
 * exposed read-only — the job has no repair step, by design.
