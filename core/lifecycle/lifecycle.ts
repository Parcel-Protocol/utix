/**
 * Deterministic lifecycle state machine for core records.
 *
 * Core records in Utix (worker jobs, notifications, export envelopes, measured
 * operations) used to carry loose booleans and status strings that every
 * consumer interpreted on its own: a queue status string, a `read` flag, an
 * `expiresAt` timestamp. That made an illegal move — retrying a settled job,
 * marking a purged notification read, re-running a completed reconciliation —
 * silently possible, and it made the UI and the API disagree about what state a
 * record was in.
 *
 * This module replaces those ad-hoc checks with one declarative table per
 * record kind:
 *
 * - every state is named, and terminal states are declared, not inferred;
 * - every legal move is an explicit `(from, event) -> to` rule;
 * - anything not in the table is rejected with a stable code, so the UI, the
 *   contract tests and the worker framework all refuse the same moves;
 * - transitions are pure. The clock, the actor and the reason are supplied by
 *   the caller, so replaying the same calls produces byte-identical records.
 *
 * `core/lifecycle/records.ts` declares the concrete record kinds; nothing here
 * knows about a particular record.
